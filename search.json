    "text": "Pre-workshop activities\n\nR and RStudio\nR and RStudio are two different but complementary tools used in data analysis and statistical computing. Understanding the difference between them is crucial (especially for beginners).\nR is a programming language and software environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. It’s the core tool that actually processes your data and performs analyses.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. Think of it as a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to write R code, manage projects, and visualize output. RStudio is not required to use R, but it significantly enhances the R programming experience!\n\n\nInstall R and R Studio\nInstall R:\n\nGo to https://cran.rstudio.com/\nChoose your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)\nDownload and install the latest version of R\n\nInstall RStudio:\n\nVisit https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nScroll down to “Download RStudio Desktop”\nClick “Download” and install the latest version of RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAlways install R before installing RStudio, as RStudio requires R to function.\n\n\n\n\nGet the workshop materials\n\nEasy way: Download from this GitHub Repo\n\n\nSophisticated way: Clone from this GitHub Repo"
