    "text": "Linear Regression\nLinear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The math formula looks like this:\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\n\\(Y\\) - the dependent variable\n\nmust be continuous\n\n\\(X\\) - the independent variable (if there are more than one, there will be \\(X_1\\) , \\(X_2\\) , and so on.\n\ncan be ordinal, nominal, or continuous\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) - the y-intercept. Represents the expected value of independent variable \\(Y\\) when independent variable(s) \\(X\\) are set to zero.\n\\(\\beta_1\\) - the slope / coefficient for independent variable\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) - the error term. (In some examples you might see this omitted from the formula).\n\nIRL Examples:\n\nDoes a person’s age affect their income?\nDo a person’s age and income affect their support towards the statusquo?"

    "text": "Pre-workshop activities\n\nR and RStudio\nR and RStudio are two different but complementary tools used in data analysis and statistical computing. Understanding the difference between them is crucial (especially for beginners).\nR is a programming language and software environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. It’s the core tool that actually processes your data and performs analyses.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. Think of it as a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to write R code, manage projects, and visualize output. RStudio is not required to use R, but it significantly enhances the R programming experience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAlways install R before installing RStudio, as RStudio requires R to function.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Install R\n\nGo to https://cran.rstudio.com/\nChoose your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)\nDownload and install the latest version of R\n\n\n\nStep 2: Install RStudio\n\nVisit https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nScroll down to “Download RStudio Desktop”\nClick “Download” and install the latest version of RStudio\n\n\n\nStep 3: Install the required packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPackages in R are collections of additional tools, functions, and datasets that extend R’s capabilities. Packages are created by contributors in the R community.\nThink of R as a smartphone, and packages as apps you download to add new features. Each package is designed to help with specific tasks or analyses, like creating graphs, analyzing particular types of data, or performing advanced statistical tests.\nPackages can save us time and leverage expert-created tools without having to write complex code from scratch. It’s very handy!\n\n\n\nOpen RStudio\nCopy the following code: install.packages(c( \"car\", \"rmarkdown\", \"huxtable\", \"gt\", \"gtsummary\", \"tidyverse\"))\nPaste it in the Console tab (see image below)\nPress Enter. Rstudio should proceed with installing the packages that we need."

Each line in the file represents a row of data, and within each row, individual pieces of data (like numbers or words) are separated by commas.\nThis format is commonly used for storing and transferring data, especially in spreadsheets and databases. Because it is literally just plain text, it is an ideal format if you have large amount of data.\nYou can open CSV files in Excel, Google Sheets, or even Notepad!\n\n\n\nData dictionary for chile_voting\nThe data is from a national survey conducted in April and May of 1988 by FLACSO/Chile, capturing voting intentions for the 1988 Chilean plebiscite. The dataset contains information about respondents’ demographic characteristics and their voting intentions.
