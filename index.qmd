## Pre-workshop activities

### R and RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are two different but complementary tools used in data analysis and statistical computing. Understanding the difference between them is crucial (especially for beginners).

**R** is a programming language and software environment specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. It's the core tool that actually processes your data and performs analyses.

**RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. Think of it as a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to write R code, manage projects, and visualize output. RStudio is not required to use R, but it significantly enhances the R programming experience!

::: callout-important
**Always** install R before installing RStudio, as RStudio requires R to function.
:::

### Step 1: Install R

1.  Go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/>

2.  Choose your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

3.  Download and install the latest version of R

### **Step 2: Install RStudio**

1.  Visit <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

2.  Scroll down to "Download RStudio Desktop"

3.  Click "Download" and install the latest version of RStudio

### Step 3: Install the required packages

::: callout-note
**Packages** in R are collections of additional tools, functions, and datasets that extend R's capabilities. Packages are created by contributors in the R community.

Think of R as a smartphone, and packages as apps you download to add new features. Each package is designed to help with specific tasks or analyses, like creating graphs, analyzing particular types of data, or performing advanced statistical tests.

Packages can save us time and leverage expert-created tools without having to write complex code from scratch. It's very handy!
:::

1.  Open RStudio

2.  Copy the following code: `install.packages(c( "car", "rmarkdown", "huxtable", "gt", "gtsummary", "tidyverse"))`

3.  Paste it in the **Console** tab (see image below)

4.  Press Enter. Rstudio should proceed with installing the packages that we need.
