## Today's Outline

1.  Descriptive Statistics
2.  Data Visualization in ggplot using World Values Survey data, including guidelines on how to choose the appropriate visualization.

## Checklist when you start RStudio

-   Load the project we created last session and open the R script file.
-   Make sure that `Environment` panel is empty (click on broom icon to clean it up)
-   Clear the `Console` and `Plots` too.
-   Re-run the `library(tidyverse)` and `read_csv` portion in the previous session

## Refresher: Loading from CSV into a dataframe

Use `read_csv` from `readr` package (part of `tidyverse`) to load our data into a dataframe

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: load-data
#| message: false
#| output: false

# import tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)

# read the CSV with WVS data
wvs_cleaned <- read_csv("data-output/wvs_cleaned_v1.csv")

# Convert categorical variables to factors
columns_to_convert <- c("country", "religiousity", "sex", "marital_status", "employment")

wvs_cleaned <- wvs_cleaned |> 
    mutate(across(all_of(columns_to_convert), as_factor))

# peek at the data, pay attention to the data types!
glimpse(wvs_cleaned)
```

## Recap: Descriptive Statistics

::: incremental
-   Univariate (i.e. single variable) Descriptive Stats

    -   Measures of central tendency: `mean()`, `median()`, `Mode()`
    -   Measures of Variability: `min()`, `max()`, `range()`, `IQR()`, `sd()` (standard deviation), `var()` (variance)
    -   Distribution shape: `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` from `moments` library. This is easier to see with histogram

-   Bivariate (i.e. two variables) Descriptive Stats

    -   Contingency table / cross tab (for categorical data)
    -   Covariance - describe how two variables vary together
    -   Correlation - describe relationship strength and direction **in a sample**. (If we want to use this to infer about a population from a sample, it would fall under inferential stats)
    -   Visualizations e.g. Scatterplots, side-by-side boxplots, stacked bar charts, etc.

## Recap: Basic R Functions for Descriptive Stats

Last week, we explored some basic R functions for descriptive statistics.

-   `mean()`: arithmetic average
-   `median()`: middle value
-   `sd()`: standard deviation
-   `var()`: variance
-   `range()`: range of values
-   `IQR()`: interquartile range
-   `summary()`: provides a summary of descriptive statistics
-   `Mode()` function from `DescTools` package: the most frequently occuring value [^1]

[^1]: R doesn't have built-in functions for mode, so we need `DescTools` package to get this function


## Recap: Long vs Wide Data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Long data:**

-   Each row is a unique observation.

-   There is a separate column indicating the variable or type of measurements

-   This format is more "understandable" by R, more suitable for visualizations (which we'll explore more next week!)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Wide data:**

-   Each row is a value in variables.

-   Each column is a value in variables --\> the more values you have, the "wider" is the data

-   This format is more intuitive for humans!
:::
:::::

## Long vs Wide Data: Examples

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Long data:**

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(kableExtra)

# Creating the wide data frame
long_data <- wvs_cleaned |>
    group_by(country, age_group) |>
    summarise(count = n()) 

long_data |> 
    kbl(caption = "Observations (Long)")  |> 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"), font_size = "85%")

```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Wide data:**

```{r}
#| echo: false

long_data |>
    pivot_wider(names_from = "age_group", values_from = "count") |> 
    kbl(caption = "Observations (Wide)") |> 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"), font_size = "85%")
```

## Long vs Wide Data: One way to spot

Pay attention to the columns of the data. 
![](images/wide-vs-long-data.jpg)


# Univariate Descriptive Stats + Visualization

## Measures of Central Tendency

Let's start by examining the `age` variable in our dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(DescTools)
# if you get an error, install the library first with this code:
# install.packages("DescTools")

# Basic statistics
mean_age <- mean(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)
median_age <- median(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)
mode_age <- DescTools::Mode(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)

# Print results
cat("Mean age:", mean_age, "\n") # cat stands for concatenate
cat("Median age:", median_age, "\n")
cat("Most frequently occuring age:", mode_age, "\n") # this is here just for demo purposes

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How we can interpret / report this:

*"The age distribution of this sample is fairly symmetrical, as indicated by the very close mean (48 years) and median (48 years) values. The mode of 54 years suggests a slight right-skew in the age distribution, with a cluster of participants in their mid-50s."*

## Measures of Variability or Dispersion

```{r}
#| echo: true


var_age <- var(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_age <- sd(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)
range_age <- range(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)
iqr_age <- IQR(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)

cat("Variance of age:", var_age, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation of age:", sd_age, "\n")
cat("Range of age:", range_age[1], "to", range_age[2], "\n")
cat("Interquartile range of age:", iqr_age, "\n")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How we can interpret / report this:

*"The age distribution of this sample is fairly wide spread. With a standard deviation of 16.72144, suggesting that most individuals' ages deviate from the mean by approximately 16.72 years. The range of ages spans from 18 to 93 years, which covers a wide range of age groups within the sample. The interquartile range (IQR) of 28 years, which represents the middle 50% of the data, indicates a moderately wide distribution of ages in the central portion of the dataset."*

## Distribution Shape

The function `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` is available through R package called `moments`. You may need to install it first before calling the library and its functions like in this code below.

```{r}
#| echo: true


library(moments)
# if you get an error, install the library first with this code:
# install.packages("moments")

skew_age <- skewness(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)
kurtosis_age <- kurtosis(wvs_cleaned$age, na.rm = TRUE)

cat("Skewness of age:", skew_age, "\n")
cat("Kurtosis of age:", kurtosis_age, "\n")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How we can interpret / report this:

*"The age distribution has a very slight right skew (skewness = 0.10), meaning there are slightly more outliers toward older ages, but the skew is minimal since values between -0.5 and 0.5 are considered approximately symmetric. The kurtosis of 2.02 is lower than a normal distribution's kurtosis of 3, indicating this distribution is platykurtic - it has lighter tails and is more uniform or "flatter" than a normal distribution."*

## Visualizing with ggplot - Histogram

-   Describing the spread and shape of distribution with just words is not very productive, so typically it is accompanied with visualization.

-   `ggplot` is plotting package that is included inside `tidyverse` package

-   works best with data in the long format, i.e., a column for all the dimensions/measures and another column for the value for each dimension/measure.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "navy") +
    labs(title = "Age distribution of respondents",
         x = "Age",
         y = "Count") +
    theme_minimal()
```

## Anatomy of ggplot code

Charts built with ggplot must include the following:

``` {.r code-line-numbers="|1|2|3|4-6|7"}
wvs_cleaned |> # <1>
    ggplot(aes(x = age)) + # <2>
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "navy") + # <3>
    labs(title = "Age distribution of respondents", # <4>
         x = "Age", # <4>
         y = "Count") + # <4>
    theme_minimal() # <5>
```

1.  **Data** - the dataframe/tibble to visualize.

2.  **Aesthetic mappings (aes)** - describes which variables are mapped to the x, y axes, alpha (transparency) and other visual aesthetics.

3.  **Geometric objects (geom)** - describes how values are rendered; as bars, scatterplot, lines, etc.

4.  Provide titles and labels to your graph

5.  (Optional) apply a theme/look to your graph

## Tip: open the ggplot cheatsheet

::: callout-tip
**A strategy I'd like to recommend:** briefly read over the `ggplot2` documentation and have them open on a separate tab. Figure out the type of variables you need to visualize (discrete or continuous) to quickly identify which visualization would make sense.

## Continuous Data - Boxplot

Let's visualize the variability with boxplot to get a better sense of the spread.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "navy") +
    labs(title = "Age distribution of respondents",
         x = "Age") +
    theme_minimal()


```

## Categorical Data - Bar chart for frequency distribution

-   The `age` variable is a numerical / continuous data. We can't apply `mean()`, `median()` and other central tendency measures to categorical data such as `age_group` or `employment_status`. We can, however, visualize them.

-   When dealing with categorical data, first take note on whether you want to visualize the **proportion** or the **frequency distribution**. 

-   Let's visualize the frequency distribution of survey participants by `country`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = country, fill = country)) +
    geom_bar() +
    labs(title = "Participants by Country",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Participants") +
    theme_minimal()

```

## Categorical Data - Pie chart for proportion

When we want to show proportion (i.e. in terms of "parts of whole"), we must first quickly calculate the proportion with `count()`

Let's create a new dataframe called `wvs_country_proportion` to hold this data.

```{r}
#| echo: true

wvs_country_proportion <- wvs_cleaned |> 
    group_by(country) |>
    summarize(n = n()) |> # count the number of participants each country
    mutate(proportion = n/sum(n)) # calculate proportion

print(wvs_country_proportion)

```



## Categorical Data - Pie chart for proportion

And then, we use this proportion table to create a pie chart by adding `coord_polar()` layer after `geom_bar()` and some changes in `aes()` and `geom_bar()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_country_proportion |> ggplot(aes(x = "", y = proportion, fill = country)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
    coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
    labs(title = "Proportion of Participants by Country") +
    theme_minimal()

```

::: aside
Note: if you have lots of categories, pie chart is not always the best option. The code for this pie chart is from [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/piechart-ggplot2.html)
:::

## Learning Check - Grammar of Graphics

Using the `wvs_cleaned` dataset:

Create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of `financial_satisfaction`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show answer"

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = financial_satisfaction)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", color = "white", binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Financial Satisfaction",
       x = "Financial Satisfaction",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```


# Bivariate Descriptive Stats + Visualization

## Three Combinations in Bivariate Descriptive Stats

Bivariate descriptive statistics describe and summarize relationships between two variables in your dataset **without making inferences about a larger population**. They include numeric measures like correlation or covariance, and visualizations like scatterplots, side-by-side boxplots, or contingency tables.

Think of them as taking a snapshot of how two variables relate to each other in your current data.

Since data can be continuous or categorical, there can be three combinations when we deal with bivariate descriptive stats:

1.  Both categorical (e.g. `age_group` and `country`)
2.  Both continuous (e.g. `financial_satisfaction` and `life_satisfaction`)
3.  One continuous, one categorical (e.g. `country` and `life_satisfaction`)

## Both categorical

-   Examine relationships between categorical variables

-   Look at joint distributions and proportions

-   Compare group compositions

First, let's create a contingency table of `age_group` and `country`!

```{r}
#| echo: true

table(wvs_cleaned$age_group, wvs_cleaned$country)

```

## Both categorical - Proportion table
We can also create a proportion table just like we did earlier

```{r}
#| echo: true

wvs_cleaned |> 
  group_by(country, age_group) |> 
  summarise(n = n()) |> # count the frequency of participants by age group and country 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) # calculate proportion

```

## Both categorical - Bar chart

For categorical data like this, we can use barchart to visualize the frequency distribution. Stacked bar chart can be used to visualize proportion.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = country, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(y = "Count", title = "Age Groups by Country") +
  theme_minimal()

```
## Both categorical - Stacked bar chart

Change `position = "dodge"` to `position = "stack"` to stack the bar chart

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = country, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") + 
  labs(y = "Count", title = "Age Groups by Country") +
  theme_minimal()

```


## Both categorical - Percent-stacked bar chart

To get a better sense of the proportion for each country, we can use percent stacked bar chart.

The code is similar to previous bar charts; we just have to change the `position` argument to `position = "fill"`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = country, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  labs(y = "Proportion", title = "Age Groups by Country") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Both continuous

-   Examine linear relationships

-   Look for patterns and trends

-   Identify potential outliers

Let's first examine the correlation between `financial_satisfaction` and `life_satisfaction`

```{r}
#| echo: true

cor(wvs_cleaned$financial_satisfaction, wvs_cleaned$life_satisfaction)

```
## Both continuous - Jitter / scatterplot

Let's visualize the two variables together with a jitter / scatterplot!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = financial_satisfaction, y = life_satisfaction)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + # layer with geom_smooth
  labs(title = "Financial vs Life Satisfaction") +
  theme_minimal()

```


## One continuous, one categorical - Summary table

-   Compare distributions across groups

-   Identify group differences

-   Examine spread within groups

Let's do a recap from last week and get the summary stats for `life_satisfaction` for each `country`

```{r}
#| echo: true

wvs_cleaned |> 
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_satisfaction = mean(life_satisfaction, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_satisfaction = median(life_satisfaction, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_satisfaction = sd(life_satisfaction, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```

## One continuous, one categorical - Boxplots

To get a better sense of how the data is varied and spread, let's visualize them with a side-by-side boxplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = country, y = life_satisfaction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Life Satisfaction by Country") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## One continuous, one categorical (cont'd) - Layered boxplots and violin plots

We could also layer our boxplots with violin plots to get a better sense of the distribution of each group. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = country, y = life_satisfaction)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white") +
  labs(title = "Life Satisfaction Distribution by Country") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## How to save your images - ggsave

There are two ways to do this:

1.  Via `ggsave`

2.  The point-and-click way in RStudio

Below is the `ggsave` way:

```r
# save the chart into an object instead of viewing it like we have been doing
boxplot_obj <- wvs_cleaned |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "navy") +
    labs(title = "Age distribution of respondents",
         x = "Age") +
    theme_minimal()

# pass the saved chart into ggsave and give it a filename
ggsave("fig-output/boxplot_1.jpg", boxplot_obj) 

```

## How to save your images - point-and-click

1.  Go to `plots` tab at the right pane
2.  Click on `Export` button. You can export the plot as image file, or as PDF. 
3.  Important: to keep your files organized, keep your exported images into the `fig-output` folder that you've created in Session 1. 


## Using Facets for more complex visualization

-   Compare patterns across multiple subgroups

-   Identify interaction effects

-   Maintain visual clarity with complex relationships

Facet grids are useful when we have more than two variables to visualize. However, if used excessively they may become too complex

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = financial_satisfaction, y = life_satisfaction)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_grid(country ~ religiousity)

```

## Is fancier = better?

Fancier, more complicated visualization does not necessarily mean better!

Take a look at this award-winning visualization by [Simon Scarr](http://www.simonscarr.com/iraqs-bloody-toll)

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54b5070de4b01c9a0176b5fd/1428238676197-BAJMDLGPHID08CCOHVDN/image-asset.png?format=1000w)


# End of Session 3!

Remember the strategy:

1.  Have the ggplot documentation/cheatsheet open
2.  Decide on how many variables are involved. Is it just one? two? more than two?
3.  Determine whether the variables are categorical or continuous. If you have more than one, are they both categorical? one categorical + one continuous?
4.  Refer to the documentation to see which type of visualization would make sense for your variables.

Check out the [R Graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) for inspiration and code samples!

Next session: inferential stats in R using WVS data

# Appendix

## At home exercise #1

Create a barchart that visualizes the frequency of `religiousity`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show answer"

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = religiousity, fill = religiousity)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Religiosity",
       x = "Religiosity",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## At home exercise #2

Create a side-by-side boxplots that visualizes `political_scale` for each `sex`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show answer"

wvs_cleaned |> ggplot(aes(x = political_scale, y = sex)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = "white") +
  labs(title = "Political scale Distribution by Sex") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Correlation Plot

When there are more than two continuous variables to explore, correlation map is sometimes used. We can achieve this with ggplot, but it's much easier to use the `corrplot()` function from the `corrplot` package.

Let's visualize the correlation map for these three variables.

```{R}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

library(corrplot)

# select all the columns for correlation calculation, save it to columns_for_corr
columns_for_corr <- wvs_cleaned |> 
  select(financial_satisfaction, life_satisfaction, age)

# pass the columns_for_corr to cor() function, and save the result to cor_matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(columns_for_corr)

# visualize the cor_matrix with corrplot()!
corrplot(cor_matrix,
         method = "shade", # show the correlation strength as color shades
         addCoef.col = "black", tl.col = "black") # label the coefficients

```

:::aside
if you get an error saying "corrplot function not found" or something along that line, that means you need to install the corrplot package first! Run this line in your RStudio Console (bottom left area): `install.packages("corrplot")`

:::

## Correlation Plot - shorter code

We can shorten the code in the previous slide using the maggritr pipe `|>` like so:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

wvs_cleaned |> 
    select(financial_satisfaction, life_satisfaction, age) |> 
    cor() |> 
    corrplot(method = "shade", # show the correlation strength as color shades
         addCoef.col = "black", tl.col = "black")
    

```

**Refresher:**

Notice that we don't have to pass the column names to `cor()` and `corrplot()` function. This is because the maggritr pipe `|>`, acts as a "conveyor belt" that take output from one step and then immediately feed it to the next step.
