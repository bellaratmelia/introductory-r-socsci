### What is a CSV?

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a type of file that stores data in a plain text format. Each line in the file represents a row of data, and within each row, individual pieces of data (like numbers or words) are separated by commas.

This format is commonly used for storing and transferring data, especially in spreadsheets and databases. Because it is literally just plain text, it is an ideal format if you have large amount of data.

You can open CSV files in Excel, Google Sheets, or even Notepad!
