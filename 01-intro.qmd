## Preamble

-   About Bella:

    -   Senior Librarian, Research & Data Services team, SMU Libraries.

    -   Bachelor in Info Tech (IT), MSc in Info Studies from NTU.

    -   Have been with SMU since the pandemic era (2021).

    -   Have been doing this workshop since Aug 2023.

-   About Wei:

    -   Principle Librarian, Instruction and Learning Services, SMU Libraries.

    -   Have been with SMU over 16 years. This is my first R workshop!

-   About this workshop:

    -   Live-coding format; code along with me!

    -   Goal of workshop: to give you enough fundamentals (at least to the point that ChatGPT can't bluff you so easily) and confidence to explore R on your own.

    -   Don't be afraid to ask for help! We are all here to learn.

## The outline for these workshops

The workshops are structured to follow this workflow when dealing with data ![](images/data-workflow.png)

## The outline for Introductory R for Social Science series

::: incremental
1.  **Import** data into R, which means take data (stored in a file, via API, etc) and load it into a dataframe in R
2.  **Tidy** the imported data.
    -   Tidy = storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset.
    -   Tidy data = each column is a variable, each row is an observation
3.  Once a data is tidy, we can **transform** it. Transformation includes:
    -   narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city or all data from the last year)
    -   creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time)
    -   calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means).
4.  Once we have tidy data with the info we need, we can **visualize** it and **model** it.
5.  **Communicate** the result. It doesn’t matter how well your models and visualization have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.

## What is R? What is R Studio?

**R**: R is an open-source programming language that was developed for statistical analysis and visualization. Community share R codes and create shortcuts.

**RStudio:** The R software environment i.e. RStudio is where we use to interact more easily with R language and scripts.

. . .

You will need to install **both** for this workshop. Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop> to download and install both if you have not done so. Remember: Install R firstly and then RStudio.

Check out the course website for a step-by-step guide.

## A Tour of RStudio

Firstly, we need to be comfortable with the RStudio interface. We will use the RStudio to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we create, and visualize the plots we generate.

![R Studio layout](images/rstudio-tour.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Before Coding

-   Setting up working directory
-   Creating projects
-   Creating folders and files

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Setting Up Working Directory

-   Working directory -\> where R will look for files (scripts, data, etc). Stay organized with all files and folders related to a project stored in one place.

    -   By default, it will be on your Desktop.

    -   Best practice is to use **R Project** to organize your files and data into projects.

    -   When using R Project, the working directory = project folder.

### Creating the project for this workshop

1.  Go to `File` \> `New project`. Choose `New directory`, then `New project`

2.  Enter `intro-r-socsci` as the name for this new folder (or "directory") and choose where you want to put this folder, e.g. `Desktop` or `Documents` if you are on Windows. This will be your working directory for the rest of the workshop!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Creating folders inside our working directory

-   `data` - we will save our raw data here. **It's best practice to keep the data here untouched.**

-   `data-output` - if we need to modify raw data, store the modified version here.

-   `fig-output` - we will save all the graphics we created here!

### Notes

Don't:

-   Don't put your R projects inside your OneDrive folder as that may cause issues sometimes.

-   Folder/file names should avoid spaces, symbols, and special characters. Prefer folder/file names that are all in lower case.

Do:

-   If for some reason your working directory is not what it should be change the working directory in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser to where your working directory should be, clicking on the blue gear icon “More”, and selecting “Set As Working Directory”.

# Let's Code!

Create a new R script - `File` \> `New File` \> `R script`.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the Ctrl + Enter shortcut (on Mac, Cmd + Return will work).

You can type commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session. It is better to type the commands in the script editor and save the script. This way, there is a complete record and can easily replicate the results.

**Note: RStudio does not autosave your progress, so remember to save from time to time!**

## R Objects and Values

In this line of code:

```{r}
#| echo: true
country_name <- "Singapore"
```

-   `"Singapore"` is a **value**. This can be either a character, numeric, or boolean data type. (more on this soon)
-   `country_name` is the **object** where we store this value. This is so that we can keep this value to be used later.
-   `<-` is the assignment operator to assign the value to the object.
    -   You can also use `=`, but generally in R, `<-` is the convention.
    -   Keyboard shortcut: `Alt` + `-` in Windows (`Option` + `-` in Mac)

## R Objects and Values

In this line of code:

```{r}
#| echo: true
country_name <- "Singapore"
```

-   `"Singapore"` is a **value**. This can be either a character, numeric, or boolean data type. (more on this soon)

-   `country_name` is the **object** where we store this value. This is so that we can keep this value to be used later.

-   `<-` is the assignment operator to assign the value to the object.

    -   You can also use `=`, but generally in R, `<-` is the convention.
    -   Keyboard shortcut: `Alt` + `-` in Windows (`Option` + `-` in Mac)

-   Object name rules:

    -   Can’t start with numbers

    -   Case sensitive

    -   No spaces

    -   Some reserved words (like some function names in R)

## Refresher: Quantitative Data Types

-   [**Non-Continuous Data**]{.underline}

    -   **Nominal/Categorical**: Non-ordered, non-numerical data, used to represent qualitative attribute.

        -   Example: nationality, neighborhood, employment status

    -   **Ordinal**: Ordered non-numerical data.

        -   Example: Nutri-grade ratings, frequency of exercise (daily, weekly, bi-weekly)

    -   **Discrete**: Numerical data that can only take specific value (usually integers)

        -   Example: Shoe size, clothing size

    -   **Binary**: Nominal data with only two possible outcome

        -   Example: pass/fail, yes/no, survive/not survive

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [**Continuous Data**]{.underline}

    -   **Interval**: Numerical data that can take any value within a range. [It does not have a "true zero".]{.underline}

        -   Example: Celsius scale. Temperature of 0 C does not represent absence of heat.

    -   **Ratio**: Numerical data that can take any value within a range. [it has a "true zero".]{.underline}

        -   Example: Annual income. annual income of 0 represents no income.

## Data Types in R

The four basic data types are **characters**, **numeric**, **boolean**, and integer. Let's look at examples using our WVS survey variables:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4"

country_code <- "SGP" # Character
life_satisfaction <- 8.5 # Numeric (also sometimes called Double)
is_religious <- TRUE # Boolean/Logical (TRUE/FALSE). case sensitive
birth_year <- 1990L # Integer (whole numbers)
```

-   To include comments in the code, use the \# character.

-   Anything to the right of the \# sign and up to the end of the line is treated as a comment and is ignored by R when executing.

-   Good practice to make notes and explain the codes.

## Checking data type of a variable

You can use `str` or `typeof` to check the data type of an R object.

```{r}
#| echo: true
typeof(country_code)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
str(is_religious) 
```

**`str` returns both data type and value.**

## Arithmetic operations in R

You can do arithmetic operations in R. For example, let's calculate average satisfaction scores:

```{r}
#| echo: true
(8 + 7 + 9) / 3  # Average of three satisfaction scores
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
2025 - 1990  # Calculate age from birth year
```

## Boolean operations in R - Simple TRUE/FALSE statements

Boolean operations in R are useful for filtering survey data. Before that, let's look at how R evaluates simple TRUE/FALSE statements

Is life_satisfaction greater than 8?

```{r}
#| echo: true

life_satisfaction <- 8.5 # assign a value of 8.5 to life_satisfaction
life_satisfaction > 8  
```

Is the country Singapore?

```{r}
#| echo: true

country_code == "SGP"  
```

Is the country NOT Singapore?

```{r}
#| echo: true

country_code != "SGP"  
```

## Boolean operations in R - AND operator

Sometimes, we may have multiple statements to evaluate. This is where the Boolean Operators will come handy.

**AND** operations (both conditions must be TRUE). In R, it is represented by ampersand `&`

Is the country New Zealand AND is the life satisfaction more than 8?

```{r}
#| echo: true

(country_code == "NZL") & (life_satisfaction > 8) 
```

`country_code == "NZL"` is FALSE while `life_satisfaction > 8` is TRUE

The whole statement will return FALSE because not all conditions TRUE.

## Boolean operations in R - OR operator

**OR** operations (at least one condition must be TRUE). In R, it is represented by pipe symbol `|`

Is the country New Zealand OR is the life satisfaction more than 8?

```{r}
#| echo: true

(country_code == "NZL") | (life_satisfaction > 8) 
```

As long as one condition is met, this will be TRUE.

## Functions in R

-   A function is like a recipe in cooking.

-   It takes some ingredients (inputs) and uses a set of instructions to produce a result (output).

-   In R, a function is a pre-written set of recipes/instructions that performs a specific task. Function name will always be followed by round brackets `()`

Example: `round()` function in R will round up numbers.

```{r}
#| echo: true
round(3.1415926)
```

-   `round()` is the "recipe", while `3.1415926` is the "ingredients"

Saving the result to an object:

```{r}
#| echo: true
rounded_pi <- round(3.1415926)
print(rounded_pi)
```

## Functions with Arguments in R

-   Following the recipe analogy, arguments are the ingredients you provide to a function. function_name(arguments/parameters)

-   Some arguments are required, while others are optional (they have default values).

-   Each argument tells the function what to use or how to perform the task.

-   Example: Think of a bubble tea order as a function. The possible arguments/ingredients here are:

    -   Tea - required ingredient

    -   Milk - optional, the default is to include

    -   Toppings - optional, the default choice is "pearls"

In R:

```{r}
#| echo: true
round(3.1415926, digits = 2)
```

-   `3.1415926` is the required argument (if this is not provided, the function will not run)

-   `digits` is an optional argument specifying how many decimal places to round to (the default is 0)

## How do I find out more about a particular function?

You can call the help page / vignette in R by prepending `?` to the function name.

E.g. if you want to find out more about the `round` function, you can run `?round` in your R console (bottom left panel)

## Packages in R

-   Packages are a collections of R functions, datasets, etc. Packages extend the functionality of R.

    -   (Closest analogy I can think of is that they're equivalent of browser add-ons, in a way)

-   Popular packages: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `shiny`, etc.

-   Installation (**you only need to do this once**): `install.packages("package name")`

-   Loading packages (*you need to run this everytime you restart RStudio*): `library(package name)` - let's try to load `tidyverse`!

    -   Tidyverse is a well-known collection of packages that facilitates data science projects. It includes packages for data manipulation, visualization, importing, and tidying.

## Data Structures in R

We will start with exploring 3 basic types of data **structures** in R:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
1.  **Vector** - can hold multiple values in a single variable/object.

2.  **Factor** - Special data structure in R to handle categorical variables.

3.  **Data frame** - De facto data structure for tabular data in R, and what we use for data processing, plotting, and statistics.

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Data Structures in R: Vectors

Think of vectors as a column in a dataset. It is the most common and basic data structure in R. (pretty much the workhorse of R!)

-   A vector can only contain 1 data type.

-   Vector can be created with c() function.

-   Can add, remove, or change values in a vector.

-   Inspect vectors: typeof(), str(), length()

```{r}
#| echo: true
countries <- c("CAN", "NZL", "SGP", "CAN", "SGP")
satisfaction_scores <- c(8, 7, 9, 6, 8)
employment_status <- c("Full time", "Student", "Part time", "Retired", "Full time")
```

## Vector Manipulations: Retrieve and update items

Retrieve the first country in the vector

```{r}
#| echo: true
countries[1]
```

Retrieves the first three satisfaction scores

```{r}
#| echo: true
satisfaction_scores[1:3]
```

Retrieves the first and the third satisfaction scores

```{r}
#| echo: true
satisfaction_scores[c(1,3)]
```

Update the first satisfaction score

```{r}
#| echo: true

satisfaction_scores[1] <- 7
print(satisfaction_scores)
```

## Why square brackets and not round brackets?

Round brackets `()` are for running functions, like using a tool: `mean()` or `sum()`.

Square brackets `[]` are for accessing specific parts of your data, where we pass the index number(s) of the element(s) we want.

## Vector Manipulations: Retrieve items based on criteria

Let's find high satisfaction scores (above 7)!

-   The code below will create a boolean vector called `criteria` that basically keep tracks on whether each items inside `satisfaction_scores` fulfil our condition.

-   The condition is "value must be \> 7". e.g. if item 1 fulfils our condition, then item 1 is 'marked' as `TRUE`. Otherwise, it will be `FALSE`

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Create boolean vector for our condition
criteria <- satisfaction_scores > 7
print(criteria)
```

-   This line of code applies the boolean vector `criteria` to `satisfaction_scores`, and only retrieve items that fulfils the condition. i.e. only return TRUE value `criteria` vector

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Use the boolean vector to filter satisfaction scores
satisfaction_scores[criteria]
```

## Vector Manipulations: Add items

Several ways to add items to a vector

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| 

satisfaction_scores <- c(satisfaction_scores, 7) # <1>
satisfaction_scores <- c(satisfaction_scores, 8, 9, 10) # <2>
satisfaction_scores <- c(8, satisfaction_scores) # <3>
satisfaction_scores <- append(satisfaction_scores, 9, after = 2) # <4>

```

1.  Add a single score to the end of the vector using c()
2.  Add multiple scores to the end
3.  Add a score to the beginning
4.  Insert a score at a specific position using append(vector_name, elements_to_be_added, from_the_position)

## Vector Manipulations: Remove items

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

satisfaction_scores <- satisfaction_scores[-c(2, 4)] # <1>
satisfaction_scores <- satisfaction_scores[satisfaction_scores <= 7] # <2>
satisfaction_scores <- na.omit(satisfaction_scores) # <3>

```

1.  Remove elements by index using "negative indexing"
2.  Remove elements based on a condition using logical indexing. Remove these items which are FALSE.
3.  Remove NA values from the vector

## Vector Manipulations: Handle NA values

-   NA values indicate null values, or the absence of a value (0 is still a value!)

-   Summary functions like `mean` needs you to inlcude argument called `na.rm` on how you want it to be handled.

Survey data often contains missing values (NA):

```{r}
#| echo: true
financial_satisfaction <- c(8, 7, NA, 6, 9, NA, 7)

# By default, mean() will return NA if there are any NA values
mean(financial_satisfaction)

# Remove NA values before calculating mean by including na.rm = TRUE
mean(financial_satisfaction, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Data Structures in R: Factors

-   Special data structure in R to deal with categorical data.

-   Look (and often behave) like character vectors but are actually treated as integer vectors.

-   Can only contain a predefined set of values, known as levels. R always sorts levels in alphabetical order

-   Can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal).

-   May look like a normal vector at first glance, so use `str()` to check.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unordered (Nominal):

```{r}
#| echo: true 
employment_factor <- factor(c("Full time", "Part time", "Student", "Retired", "Student"))
str(employment_factor)
```

Ordered (Ordinal):

```{r}
#| echo: true 
importance_factor <- factor(
    c("Very important", "Important", "Not very important", "Not at all important"),
    ordered = TRUE,
    levels = c("Not at all important", "Not very important", "Important", "Very important")
)
str(importance_factor)
```

## Data Structures in R: Dataframe

-   De facto data structure for tabular data in R, and what we use for data processing, plotting, and statistics.

-   Similar to spreadsheets - a rectangular collection of variables (columns) and observations (rows)!

-   You can create it by hand like so:

```{r}
#| echo: true
survey_data <- data.frame(
    country = c("SGP", "CAN", "NZL", "SGP", "CAN"),
    life_satisfaction = c(8, 7, 9, 6, 8),
    employment = c("Full time", "Student", "Part time", "Retired", "Full time")
)
print(survey_data)
```

## Data Structures in R: Others

-   Lists: A type of recursive vector

-   Matrices: A collection of elements of the same type in rows and columns

## Downloading the World Values Survey (WVS) Dataset

For this workshop, we will try loading a dataset from a file.

Go to the course website and go to the ['Dataset'](https://bellaratmelia.github.io/introductory-r-socsci/dataset.html) tab to download the data file and information about this WVS data

Download this CSV and save it under your `data` folder in your R project!

## Loading the WVS Dataset

Let's load our actual World Values Survey dataset using read_csv function.

Before use read_csv install and load package tidyverse. Install the package only once and need to load the package in every session before you use it.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)

wvs_data <- read_csv("data/wvs-wave7-sg-ca-nz.csv")  
head(wvs_data)
```

Make sure to save the CSV file in your data folder! (No auto save)

## Exploring the WVS Dataset

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
#| eval: false

dim(wvs_data) # <1>
names(wvs_data) # <2>
str(wvs_data) # <3>
summary(wvs_data) # <4> 
head(wvs_data, n=5) # <5>
tail(wvs_data, n=5) # <6>
```

1.  return a vector of number of rows and columns
2.  inspect columns
3.  inspect structure
4.  print the summary stats of the entire dataframe
5.  view the first 5 rows
6.  view the last 5 rows

## Basic dataframe manipulations: Retrieving values

Some basic dataframe functions before we move on to data wrangling next week:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
#| eval: false

wvs_data["country"] # <1>
wvs_data$country # <2>
wvs_data[3]  # <3>
wvs_data[1, 4] # <4> 
wvs_data[3, ] # <5>
```

1.  retrieve column by column name (returns as tibble/dataframe)
2.  another way to retrieve column by name (returns as vector)
3.  retrieve column by index
4.  get a cell at this row, column coord
5.  get an entire row

## Trouble Shooting

Types of messages

-   Error: Fatal error in your code that prevented it from being run through successfully. Need to fix it for the code to run.

-   Warning: Non-fatal errors (don’t stop the code from running, but this is a potential problem that you should know about).

-   Message: Helpful information about the code you just ran(can usually ignore these messages)

## Trouble Shooting

Check. Did you...

-   Set your working directory?

-   Check for missing commas (,), parentheses ()?

-   Check your spelling?

    -   Spelling : Punctuation \<- mea**a**n(c(1, 2, 3, 4)) or print(Punctuati**o**on)

    -   Punctuation : sum(10?20) or Punctuation \<- sum(c(10, 20))**)**

    -   Capitalization : s**U**m(c(5, 10, 15))

    -   In text indicators : X **+** Y or **\#**taking notes or “name” vs name

## Recap

-   R & RStudio: R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics, while RStudio is an environment that makes it easier to write, run, and manage R code.

-   Working Directory: A folder on your computer where R reads and saves files.

-   Data Type: Types of value an object can hold, such as numeric, character, and Boolean.

-   Data Structure: Data structures organize and store data in R, such as vectors, factors, and data frames.

-   Functions: Reusable codes that perform specific tasks. Can call functions with arguments.

-   Packages: Collections of functions and data to perform tasks. Need to install and load packages.

# End of Session 1!

Next Session: Data wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages - we'll learn how to:

-   Filter survey responses by country

-   Calculate average satisfaction scores by demographic groups

-   Create new variables from existing ones

-   Handle missing values in survey data

-   And much more!
